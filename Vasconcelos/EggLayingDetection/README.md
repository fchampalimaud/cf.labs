# Egg Lying Detection

## Summary

This code generates a csvfile with the indexes of the frames around which a new egg has been laid. 

## Instructions

Instructions to run the code:

1. Download the files EggLayingDetection.bonsai and EggLayingDetectoin.bonsai.layout above to a directory
2. Download the example video from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w3PRUTDEaacFbKqX3VyigJamGC3IDU-g/view?usp=sharing) to the same directory.
3. Run the file EggLayingDetection.bonsai until the video file has finished.
4. The file EggLayingFrames.csv is generated with the frame numbers around which a new egg has been laid.


## Current issues

From the quick tests I have made, the frames recorded are about 100-200 frames after the actual egg laying.
