To create local version of Bonsai compatible with the package, simply go to the "bonsai" folder inside the your package folder and run (double-click on) the file "setup.cmd". This creates a file "bonsai.exe" which you can use to run your package. 

The media files as well as the protocols necessary to run the experiments can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aLADsfKP51p04kRPCuURHoUFrnCmxjav?usp=sharing). Simply download the folder 'resources' to your project directory.
